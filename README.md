# digital_sensor_fusion
I have started and designed my first Arduino project with an Elegoo Uno R3 and wired two sensors (HC-SR04 + DHT11) to determine Ultrasonic distance overtime.

I have measured this data from Serial Monitoring at about ~16 seconds moving my hand closer and farther. The data also measures temperature in degrees Celcius and its humidity.
